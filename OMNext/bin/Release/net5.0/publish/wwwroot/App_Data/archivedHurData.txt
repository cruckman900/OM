<p>It appears that Bob has been stalled near latitude 16.5 north...longitude 54.9 west, or about 755 km east of Montserrat, and is moving very slowly westward with hurricane force winds extending 225 kilometers from its center. The estimated minimum central air pressure is 978 mbar. Bob is now a category two hurricane with sustained winds in excess of 161 kph.</p>
<p>Real-time data will be sent at five-minute intervals during the mission. Remember that five minutes of e-Mission time is equal to 1.5 hours of Montserrat time.</p>
