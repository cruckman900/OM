	<p>Follow the prompts on the interface to help you organize the information for emergency briefings and bulletins. Briefings are given orally (radio/TV broadcast or podcast), and bulletins use written information (text messages, flyers, scripts). During the mission, you will be giving one 3-minute midpoint briefing, one 3-minute endpoint briefing, and will be creating several online bulletins.</p>

	<b>Sample Broadcast</b>
	<p>This is Buck Grimbaldi coming to you live from Broderick's Estate where a storage barn has been blown over by a gust of wind estimated at over 150 kilometers an hour. As you can see, this barn, on the edge of Aymer's Ghaut has spilled a massive quantity of fertilizer into the waterway, creating a chemical hazard for humans and livestock downstream. Drinking or touching the water could be extremely hazardous. Montserrat Emergency Services has declared a chemical emergency and is sending hazmat crews to clean up the spill. In the meantime, residents are being warned to stay away from the waterways downstream and not to drink or use the water until further notice. Updates will be available on this broadcast station as the situation changes.</p>
