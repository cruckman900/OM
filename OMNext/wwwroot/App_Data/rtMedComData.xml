		<alert>The Soufriere Hills Volcano has been showing periods of higher than normal activity over the last few weeks. Yesterday, activity levels rose once again. Ash clouds have been nearly constant for over 24 hours. Yesterday, the prevailing winds were from the south, carrying the ash over much of the northern part of the island. Ash depth is 1 cm at the St. Johns observation station.</alert>
		<directives>Make a list of the current and potential medical and safety hazards associated with the volcano and tropical storm. You must understand the potential issues so that you may be prepared to handle any situation that may occur. Develop a list of options. Thinking medically, begin to prepare your first communications broadcast. This will be submitted online for transmission to the island.</directives>

		<alert>Wind is changing direction. Currently holding steady from the east at 4kph. Tests show that the composition of minerals in the ashfall includes 91% pumiceous glass, 6% cristabolite, and 3% other minerals, including quartz, plagiocase and mafic minerals. Residents are reporting that young children playing outside are suffering from eye and throat irritation. Many children are reported to have hacking dry coughing spells. A few residents have reported to be suffering from hacking cough, sputum, wheezing, and shortness of breath.</alert>
		<directives>Many small villages do not have access to emergency personnel or doctors. What medical and safety hazard recommendations can you report to the people of Montserrat? Make a list, with options for each. Your team will use this list later. Do you have a report form for Mission Control? What medical or safety hazard recommendations can you report to the people of Montserrat?</directives>

		<alert>Sulfur dioxide gas has been detected at observation stations on the southern half of the island. Residents are complaining of foul-tasting water. Wind gusts have been reported. Several trees have fallen across the road in Salem and broken power lines. It has been reported that a man is unconscious and laying in the vicinity of one of the power lines. There is growing concern that more people will be critically injured if they unknowingly walk into active downed lines.</alert>
		<directives>For each medical or safety hazard you encounter, complete a written recommendation to be given to the Communications Team. Determine how to rescue and treat the critically injured resident from the downed power line. Information on treatment for this injury should be relayed to the public in the event of future accidents. Determine how to warn residents of this dangerous situation. This requires immediate attention.</directives>

		<alert>A church has burned down after its roof was ignited by tephra projectiles from the volcano. There are burn victims. Currently there are no doctors in the vicinity. Local residents would like to assist the burn victims. However they are untrained and need information on how to treat these victims. We have no additional information regarding the type of burns we are dealing with, although we believe they range from 1st degree to 3rd degree burns.</alert>
